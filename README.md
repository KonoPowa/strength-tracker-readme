# Progressive Overload Made Easy (WIP)
This app is designed to help users make progress in their strength training by utilizing the principle of progressive overload. Progressive overload is the concept of gradually increasing the weight or resistance of an exercise over time in order to challenge the muscles and promote growth and adaptation.

This app makes it easy to track and record the user's workouts, including the specific exercises performed, the weight lifted or resistance used, and the number of sets and reps completed. This allows the user to keep a comprehensive record of their training over time, which is essential for monitoring progress and identifying areas for improvement.

In addition to tracking workouts, the app provides analytics that allow the user to visualize their progress over time. This includes graphs and charts that show how their strength and performance have improved over the course of weeks or months. 

The app is built using React-Native. The backend is powered by Firebase Store and Auth, which ensures only authorized users can access the app and their data.

Overall, this app is designed to help users make progress in their strength training by providing an easy and convenient way to track workouts and monitor progress over time.
